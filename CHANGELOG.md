## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Initial `nudgekit-core` alpha with the core tip model, rule system, evaluator, state model, counters, and manager contract.
- Built-in rules for dismissal, single display, max display count, event thresholds, screen visit thresholds, minimum interval, and custom predicates.
- Android-free `nudgekit-core` module so eligibility logic can stay independent from Android framework code.
- Initial `nudgekit-datastore` alpha with `DataStoreTipManager` persistence, evaluation helpers, and reactive observation APIs.
- Initial `nudgekit-compose` alpha with `InlineTip`, `ManagedInlineTip`, `TipBox`, `ManagedTipBox`, `TipPosition`, and default styling helpers.
- Sample app demonstrating inline tips, anchored tips, event tracking, screen tracking, and reset flows.
- Initial project documentation covering setup, rules, datastore usage, Compose UI, sample app behavior, limitations, and roadmap.

### Known Limitations
- No Compose UI tests yet.
- `TipBox` positioning is intentionally simple and not pixel-perfect.
- `nudgekit-compose` currently depends on `nudgekit-datastore`.
- Managed components currently observe all counters and use `collectAsState` instead of `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`.
- Maven publishing is not configured yet.
