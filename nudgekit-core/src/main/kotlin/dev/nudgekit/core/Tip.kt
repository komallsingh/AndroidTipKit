 * A contextual tip that can be shown to the user when all [rules] are satisfied.
 *
 * Tips are immutable value objects. Define them as top-level `val` constants
 * or inside an `object` holder and reuse the same instance throughout the app.
 *
 * [id] must be **unique and stable** across the app: it is the persistence key
 * for this tip's state (dismissed flag, display count, last-shown time). Two
 * tips sharing an [id] would share — and corrupt — each other's state, and
 * changing an [id] later resets that tip's history.
