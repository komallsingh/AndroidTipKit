# Sample App

The `:sample` module is a working Android app that demonstrates every part of the current MVP. Build and install it with:

```bash
./gradlew :sample:assembleDebug
adb install sample/build/outputs/apk/debug/sample-debug.apk
```

JDK 17 is required.

## What it demonstrates

`MainActivity.kt` shows four sections, each illustrating a different NudgeKit feature.

### 1. Inline tip — `ManagedInlineTip` with `NotDismissed`

```kotlin
private val filterTip = Tip(
    id = "use_filters",
    title = "Use Filters",
    message = "Narrow down results by applying filters to find exactly what you need.",
    actionLabel = "Try Filters",
    rules = listOf(TipRule.NotDismissed),
)

ManagedInlineTip(
    tip = filterTip,
    manager = manager,
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    onActionClick = { /* navigate to filters */ },
)
```

Always eligible until the user taps dismiss. Re-runs on `resetAll`.

### 2. Anchored tip — `ManagedTipBox` with `MaxDisplayCount(3)`

```kotlin
private val notificationTip = Tip(
    id = "enable_notifications",
    title = "Enable Notifications",
    message = "Stay updated with order status and exclusive deals.",
    actionLabel = "Enable",
    rules = listOf(
        TipRule.NotDismissed,
        TipRule.MaxDisplayCount(3),
    ),
)

ManagedTipBox(
    tip = notificationTip,
    manager = manager,
    position = TipPosition.Bottom,
    onActionClick = { /* open notification settings */ },
) {
    Button(onClick = { /* … */ }, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
        Text("Notification Settings")
    }
}
```

Shows up to 3 times across launches. After the 3rd appearance, it stops showing until `resetAll`.

### 3. Event-driven tip — `AfterScreenVisits`

```kotlin
private val addressTip = Tip(
    id = "save_address",
    title = "Save Your Address",
    message = "Save your delivery address for faster checkout next time.",
    rules = listOf(
        TipRule.NotDismissed,
        TipRule.AfterScreenVisits("checkout", 2),
    ),
)
```

Hidden initially. The user must tap the "Visit Checkout" button at least twice for the tip to become eligible. Tapping "View Item" calls `trackEvent("item_viewed")` to demonstrate event tracking (no tip uses this event in the sample — it is there to show the API).

### 4. Reset

```kotlin
OutlinedButton(
    onClick = { scope.launch { manager.resetAll() } },
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
) {
    Text("Reset All Tips")
}
```

Clears all state and counters. All tips become eligible again as if the app were freshly installed.

## Manager instantiation pattern

The sample creates one `DataStoreTipManager` per `Activity` instance using `by lazy`:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    private val manager: DataStoreTipManager by lazy {
        DataStoreTipManager.create(applicationContext)
    }
    // …
}
```

This is simple and works for a demo. **Production apps should use a process-wide singleton** — typically on the `Application` class — so configuration changes don't construct fresh DataStore instances. See [getting-started.md](getting-started.md#2-create-one-datastoretipmanager).

## Try this

1. Launch the app — the "Use Filters" tip is visible immediately.
2. Tap "Dismiss" on it. It disappears and stays gone.
3. Tap "Visit Checkout" once. Nothing happens yet — the address tip needs 2 visits.
4. Tap "Visit Checkout" again. The "Save Your Address" tip appears.
5. The "Enable Notifications" tip uses `MaxDisplayCount(3)`. Restart the app three times. After the 3rd launch, the tip stops appearing.
6. Tap "Reset All Tips". All three tips reappear.
